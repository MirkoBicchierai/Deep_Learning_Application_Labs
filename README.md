# DLA Laboratory

This repository contains the work for laboratories 1, 3, and 4, organized within the folders `LAB_1/`, `LAB_3/`, and `LAB_4/` respectively.

Inside each lab folder, you will find a dedicated README file where I have detailed the results obtained, the personal choices I made and the reasons behind them, as well as the various sources of inspiration I referred to. I encourage you to read these README files for a comprehensive understanding of each lab.

To support the results, you can also visit the following public Weights & Biases (wandb) project links:

- **LAB_1:** [https://wandb.ai/AI-UNIFI/DLA_LAB_1?nw=nwusermirkobicchierai](https://wandb.ai/AI-UNIFI/DLA_LAB_1?nw=nwusermirkobicchierai)

Recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (example using conda)
conda create -n DLA-LAB
